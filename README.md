JabRef is an open-source citation and reference management tool that allows users to collect and organize sources while providing an interface that can be used to edit BibTex files. It particularly allows users to import information from online scientific databases. It is largely used by students and researchers in academia and for good reasons. JabRef makes research easier with organization and collection functionalities that include retrieving and linking full-text articles, importing new references directly from the web browser with a single click.
